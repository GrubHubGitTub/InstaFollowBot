# InstaFollowBo
###Grow your business by following the followers of a specified instagram account.

# Installation instructions

Choose your webdriver by commenting out the one you do not need. (Pre configured for Edge and Chrome drivers).

Create a .env file with:

- email= "yourinstaemail@gmail.com"
- pw= "password"


## Run main.py. 
- ### When prompted, enter the account you would like to get followers from. You can enter a search term and it will get the top result.
- ### Choose to log in via Facebook or Instagram (type ig or fb in the console when prompted)
##Due to instagram not liking bots, the app will follow 50 during one process. Run again if you want more followers, but you may be stopped from following after a certain amount of time. 
##### If you get some errors, the app may run better if you remove the headless option in the webdriver options.
